  # Mediator object
  # ---------------

  # The mediator is a simple object all others modules use to
  # communicate with each other. It implements the Publish/Subscribe pattern.
  #
  # Additionally, it holds some common objects which need to be shared
  # between modules: the user and the router.
  #
  # You might store additional objects on the mediator or
  # you might introduce another object(s) as shared data storage
  # so this mediator doesnâ€™t get the kitchen sink of your app.

  mediator = {}

  # Descriptor for readonly, non-configurable properties
  readonlyDescriptor = writable: false, configurable: false, enumerable: true
  descriptorsSupported = support.propertyDescriptors

  # Current user
  # ------------

  mediator.user = null

  # Overwrite the user property with a getter and a no-op setter.
  # The actual user is saved as a private variable.
  if descriptorsSupported
    privateUser = null

  # Set the user from outside
  mediator.setUser = (user) ->
    if descriptorsSupported
      # Change the private variable
      privateUser = user
    else
      # Change the public property
      mediator.user = user

  # Make the setUser method readonly
  if descriptorsSupported

  # The Router
  # ----------

  mediator.router = null

  # Include Backbone event methods for global Publish/Subscribe
  _(mediator).extend Backbone.Events

  # Initialize an empty callback list (so we might seal the object)
  mediator._callbacks  = null

  # Finish
  # ------
